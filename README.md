**An iOS SwiftUI prototype designed to help students understand and manage procrastination, developed collaboratively for the Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching (BLCT) at Bowdoin College.**

## Project Overview

*Procrastination-BLCT* emerged from an academic collaboration aimed at addressing student procrastination by providing a tool grounded in empirical research. Developed during the Fall 2022 semester, this project involved a team with expertise in development, content specialization, academic advising, project management, and video production.

The goal was to create an accessible, user-friendly iOS application leveraging Swift and SwiftUI to guide students through regular check-ins, reflections, and empirically-supported anti-procrastination techniques.

This repository contains the source code for the working prototype as of December 2022.

## Key Features (Prototype Stage)

*   **Account Setup:** Onboarding process to personalize the experience (motto goals, reminder songs, semester goals).
*   **Home Screen:** Displays motto goal and picture, central navigation point.
*   **Daily Check-in:** Quick mood/success tracking related to procrastination and applied "life hacks."
*   **Weekly Check-in:** Structured review of progress towards weekly goals.
*   **Reflection & Analysis:** Prompts users to identify reasons for procrastination based on their weekly performance.
*   **Content Integration:** Placeholders for video content and links designed to provide targeted advice.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Swift 5
*   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (with some UIKit elements)
*   **Platform:** iOS (Target: 16.0+)
*   **IDE:** Xcode
*   **Dependencies:** `swift-algorithms` (via Swift Package Manager)

## Project Status

This project is an **archived academic prototype**. It represents the state of development at the end of the Fall 2022 semester.

## Wireframes / Design Process

We first developed flow maps, then wireframes, before implementation:
