# Procrastination-BLCT

**Project Overview**

*Procrastination-BLCT* was an academic project that attempted to build a procrastination app from scratch for the Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching (BLCT) center at Bowdoin College. This collaborative endeavor was undertaken to address growing student procrastination and provide a solution integrated with empirical procrastination research.

Screens included in this iteration: Account Setup, Home, Daily Check-In, Weekly Check-In, and Reflection.

## Project Highlights

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The *Procrastination-BLCT* project was a collaborative effort between a lead developer, content specialist, academic advisor, project manager(and an additional content specialist), and video producer & scriptwriter.

- **Inclusive Design**: To create an inclusive and accessible user experience, the project leveraged comprehensive wireframes, Swift, and SwiftUI. This focus on user accessibility aimed to make the app usable and effective for a wide range of users.

- **Empirical Foundations**: The project delved deep into empirical research on procrastination, drawing from the expertise of the content specialist and project manager. This enriched the app's content and educational materials, ensuring it was rooted in psychological principles.
